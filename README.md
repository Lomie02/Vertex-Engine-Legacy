-= VERTEX ENGINE 2 =-

Vertex is a custom game engine made with C++ & OpenGL, this engine was create during my 2nd year of AIE (2022) as a challenge for myself to understand c++ as well as engine structure

PLEASE NOTE:

Vertex requires visual studio 2019 to work! The engine will be adjusted for newer versions of visual studio later in its development. 
This project started as a way to challenge myself to learn complex systems
